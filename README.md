## ✅ Business Questions Solved with SQL + Insights & Recommendations

### 1. What is the Monthly ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)?
**Insight:** Revenue fluctuates across months, with some months showing noticeably higher average spend.  
**Recommendation:** Use high ARPU months to replicate promotional or pricing strategies that worked.

---

### 2. Who are the Top 5 Revenue-Generating Customers?
**Insight:** A small portion of customers generate a large part of the revenue.  
**Recommendation:** Retain and reward high-value users with loyalty programs or exclusive offers.

---

### 3. Which regions or genders generate the most revenue?
**Insight:** Male users in cities like Lahore and Islamabad show higher average charges.  
**Recommendation:** Tailor pricing or marketing strategies for high-performing demographics and regions.

---

### 4. What is the customer churn rate over time?
**Insight:** Several customers show no usage for over 2 months — signaling churn.  
**Recommendation:** Trigger reactivation campaigns or exit surveys for these users.

---

### 5.  What are the monthly trends in call minutes vs. data usage?
**Insight:** Data usage is rising faster than call minutes over time.  
**Recommendation:** Focus on high-speed data plans and bundles to match user demand.

---

### 6.  Which services (Call, SMS, Data) are most used?
**Insight:** Data dominates usage patterns, while SMS is declining.  
**Recommendation:** Prioritize internet-focused plans and consider phasing out unused SMS bundles.

---

### 7.  Are Prepaid or Postpaid users more profitable?
**Insight:** Postpaid users show higher ARPU on average.  
**Recommendation:** Upsell prepaid users into postpaid plans with attractive packages.

---

### 8.  Which gender has a higher churn rate?
**Insight:** Female users have a slightly higher churn rate in this dataset.  
**Recommendation:** Investigate the causes and develop engagement strategies tailored to female users.

---

### 9.  How many customers switched plan types?
**Insight:** Several customers moved between prepaid and postpaid within months.  
**Recommendation:** Monitor migration patterns to improve retention within each plan type.

---

### 10.  What is the latest plan type per customer?
**Insight:** Some users switched plans multiple times, indicating dissatisfaction or exploration.  
**Recommendation:** Streamline offerings or improve customer onboarding to reduce switching frequency.

---

### 11. ❌ Who are the inactive customers (no usage)?
**Insight:** A portion of the customer base had zero activity in a full billing cycle.  
**Recommendation:** Flag these users for churn prevention efforts or alternative offers.

---

### 12.  What is the monthly data usage trend by plan type?
**Insight:** Postpaid users consume more data compared to prepaid users.  
**Recommendation:** Invest in unlimited or larger data plans for postpaid users to maximize retention.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

| **Challenge**                        | **Solution**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Handling inactive months            | Used `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE()` to include customers with missing usage   |
