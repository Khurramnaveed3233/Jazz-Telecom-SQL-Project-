**Insight:** Several customers show no usage for over 2 months ‚Äî signaling churn.  
**Recommendation:** Trigger reactivation campaigns or exit surveys for these users.

---

### 5.  What are the monthly trends in call minutes vs. data usage?
**Insight:** Data usage is rising faster than call minutes over time.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

| **Challenge**                        | **Solution**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Handling inactive months            | Used `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE()` to include customers with missing usage   |
